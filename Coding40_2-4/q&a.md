## What is data structure ?
- Data structure are  simply storage format which stores datas in a a optimized and easy accessible manner.
- Example - array,linkedlist, stack, Binarytree,etc.
## What is an array ? 
- An array is a linear data structre which stores homogeneous data item in a continues memory location.
## What is a linked list ?
- Linked is also a linear data structures whose smallest unit is called as node.In case of single linked list node mostly consist of two parts one is data part and another is address part.
- In data part we have the data of that node in adress part we have the address of the next node.
- The elements are not neccsarily stored in continous manner.
- Stating node of linked list is called and head node.
- Ending node always have null in the address part.
- We have also doublylinkedlist and circular linked list.
## What is LIFO  ?
- LIFO stands for last in first out data structures base on this principle stack concept is came.
- According to the priciple the element that is going to enter in the container last is neccesarily comes out first.
- Valid parenthesis check is the example racking of book on top of each other is also the example of the principle.
## What is stack ?
- Stack is a linear data starucutre which based on the priciple of LIFO.
- These data structure came to solve a particular kind of problem.
- In stack we can access element only from top.
## What is FIFO ?
- FIFO stands for first in first out this is also a principle to solve a certain kind of problem.
- Based on this principle Queue data structure is build in.
- We can access the element from the queue only from front.
## What is queue ?
- Queue is also a linear data structure based on the principle of FIFO.
- For example a queue of student the person standing in front will be accesed first.
## What is binary tree ?
- ?
## What is Recursion ?
- The process in which a function called itself indirectly  or directly is called as recursion.
- The function which perform this kind of operation is called as recursive function.
## What is OOPS concept ?
- OOPS is a programming paradigm or way of organising and optimizing our code so that the readability and maintainability of the code will be improved.
- Oops mainly deals with classes and object.
- It have the four main concpet which is known as the pillars of the oops.
    - Inheritance
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Polymorphisim
## Explain binary search tree ?
- ?
## Explain doubly linked list ?
- It is a varient of linked list as we know the smallest unit of linked list in known as node. In doubly linked list the node consist of a value part and two address part.
- In head node the left adress part conatin null as it is the head and value part contain value and the right address part contains the address of the next node.
- The last node right address part is going to stores null.
## What is graph ?
- ?
## Difference between linear and non-linear data structures ?
- linear data structure
---
- In linear data structure all the element are connected to each other in such a way that we can travese all the element in a single run.
- *Example* array,stack,queue,linked-list etc.
- non-linear data structure 
---
- In this data structure elemets are arranged in such a way that we can't travese all the element in a single run.
- The branching of nodes or element takes place.
- *Example* graph,tree etc
## What is dequeue ?
- This means a double ended queue in which we can access element from both side this can also work as a stack.
- Theater seat arrangement is also example of dequeue.
## What is the best sorting algorithm ?
- There are different type of sorting algorithm for example - quick sort, bubble sort , inssertion sort,selection sort,merge sort.
- We can't consider anything to be best because these all are build to overcome certain specific type of problem.SO depending upon situation we have to consider which algorith is best that is the beauty of algorithms.
## How does the variable declaration affect memory space ?
- The more used variable we will use in our program without flusing that will consume more memory.
## What is dynamic data structure ? 
- The data structure we can't prdicet the size that size may grow or shrink at the runtime according to our need is considerd as dynamic data structure.
- The case where we don't know the element size or number of input or element we use this data structure which internally build to overcome this sitution by managing its size.
- Example stack linked list etc.
